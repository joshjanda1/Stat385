## R Markdown Introduction

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an R Markdown document. The code chunk `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)` is used to setup the document and how it processes these chunks below. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You need to label your code chunks, and these labels must be unique. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

The label was *cars* and was written in the curly braces after `r`. You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## The Homework Problems

Below you will find problems for you to complete as an individual. It is fine to discuss the homework problems with classmates, but cheating is prohibited and will be harshly penalized if detected.


### 1. With the `data(pressure)` dataset in R, do the following:

a. run the command that shows the help page of the median function
```{r}
?median
```


b. show the first 10 rows and 2 columns of the `data(pressure)` dataset
```{r}
pressure[1:10, 1:2]
```


c. run the command `head(pressure)`
```{r}
head(pressure)
```


d. describe the differences between parts **b** and **c**.

The differences between parts **b** and **c** is that in part b, we are explicitly printing the first 10 rows of the first and second column in the data. In part c, we are using the head function which almost does the same thing except that he head function prints the first 6 rows as well as **all** of the columns in the dataset, not just the first two.


### 2. With the `data(cars)` dataset in R, compute the following:

a. the median of the stopping distance
```{r}
median(cars$dist)
```


b. the mean of the speed
```{r}
mean(cars$speed)
```

c. the six number summary of both the mean and speed
```{r}
summary(cars)
```


d. the plot of the stopping distance (vertical axis) versus the speed (horizontal axis) making sure the axes are written exactly as "distance" and "speed", while the title as "Speed and Stopping Distances of Cars".
```{r}
plot(
     cars$speed,
     cars$dist,
     xlab = "Speed",
     ylab = "Distance",
     main = "Speed and Stopping Distances of Cars"
    )
```


### 3. With the `data(iris)` dataset in R, do the following calculations:

a. the sum of the 25th and 26th versicolor iris's sepal lengths divided by 2
```{r}
versicolors = subset(iris, Species == "versicolor") #subset data into only versicolors
sum(versicolors$Sepal.Length[25], versicolors$Sepal.Length[26]) / 2
```


b. the sum of all petal lengths among all species of iris that are between 0 cm and 3 cm
```{r}
sum(iris$Petal.Length[iris$Petal.Length <= 3])
```


c. assuming `x` equals the sepal length of the 10th virginica iris, then $4\cdot x/2^3$

d. assuming `x` equals the sum of all setosa sepal widths, then $4\cdot(x/2)^3$.


### 4. Using the Instructor Notes from Week 03, address the following:

a. run the code that appears in slide 20 of the intro-slides.pdf slide deck.

b. change the seed number in the `set.seed()` command from 13 to 14. Then, re-run the code in part **a**.

c. Is there a difference between the results of parts **a** and **b**? If so, describe some of the obvious differences.

d. Why is it important to set the random seed at the beginning of a simulation?

### 5. Incorporate images that address the following:

a. a screenshot that shows your personal repo in GitHub Enterprise

b. a screenshot of the Git terminal (or shell) open within RStudio

c. a screenshot of RStudio with the 4 panes basic such that there's a Git tab in the top right pane, and the files in the repo in the bottom right pane

d. the push/pull pop up window of RStudio with the final commit message of your homework submission.
